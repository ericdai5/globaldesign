## Icons

Since icons are extremely simplistic and usually consist of one color, their interpretations could vary wildly between different cultures, which could lead to misunderstanding and poor usability. When it comes to designing for audiences across countries, it is beneficial have a set of different icons for the regional product version or to add text labels next to important icons.

### Solution: Text Labels

One solution to help users understand icons is to add text labels. For instance, Amazon encountered a design problem in 2018 caused by a lack of testing for their search UI. Specifically, there are users from countries such as India who do not understand the meaning of the magnifying glass icon and have mistaken the icon for a ping-pong paddle. Thus, to combat this, Amazon added an additional text label in their search bar to clarify the function of the search bar.

### Solution: Alternate Icons

Another way to ensure better user understanding is to use specific icons for specific countries and demographics. For instance, the pharmacy icon varies widely between countries such that peopleâ€™s interpretation of a specific icon may vary widely depending on the region.

## Images

Images are a special topic because an image could be considered either appropriate or inappropriate due to different expectations in terms of dressing norms, gender norms, and religious norms across cultures.

### Solution: Adhere to Norms

Know what is considered to be appropriate or inappropriate for certain user populations. For instance, know whether certain ways of dressing - swimwear, dresses, and shoes - are considered to be appropriate across multiple cultures, religions, and geographies.

### Solution: Representation

Make sure that your images accurately portray your user-bases values, needs, and beliefs. The best way to ensure good representation is to work with native speakers and people who are native to your target geographic region.

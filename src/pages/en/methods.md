## Factors to Consider

There are distinctions for researching international users. A few factors to think about:

- Differences in usage scenarios
- Differences in interview preferences
- Primary devices used by the target demographic
- Local wifi, cellular service, and internet connection

## Special Methods

<div class="highlightbox4">
    <h4>Cultural Probes</h4>
    <p>Engage audiences by letting them give open-ended feedback that can be based on a variety of mediums. Responses could come in the form of writing, sketches, and photos that can be studied later to reveal how users think and feel. This method is low-tech.</p>

    <h4>The Bollywood Method</h4>
    <p>In certain cultures, people shy away from giving honest feedback because it is viewed as impolite or embarrassing. This technique places participants into a hypothetical scenario where they can voice their thoughts honestly without the fear of being judged.</p>

<div class="highlightbox4">
    <h4>Reframe Questions</h4>
    <p>Instead of posing questions that are born from assumptions such as “we know that users…”, start with open questions that could provide us with a large variety of answers that we can further investigate.</p>

<div class="highlightbox4">
    <h4>Local / Centralized Testing</h4>
    <p>Certain scenarios can be tested remotely, while other concepts and features would benefit from in-situation testing. Certain industries that benefit from in-situation testing may be navigation, eCommerce, and education.</p>

<div class="highlightbox4">
    <h4>Optimal Session Duration</h4>
    <p>Ask local partners and recruiters about the optimal session length. In certain cultures, people prefer to build trust and rapport before they dive down into more serious topics; in other cultures, people just hop in. Decide on the appropriate session duration.</p>

## Budgeting

There are research methods that fit every budget, but the biggest trade-off comes from deciding between in-person and remote.

    <h4>In-person</h4>
    <p>Understanding and connecting with participants better while observing the nuances of cultural differences. Well suited for exploratory research with an ethnographic focus. International research costs a lot more than a remote study because of travel and in-person translators. In certain cases, it is more cost-efficient to recruit participants that are bilingual, but this comes at the cost of biases and divergence from the initial target background. It can also sometimes be less costly because of lower fees, and research partners can make the process more efficient.</p>

    <h4>Remote</h4>
    <p>Good for evaluating UI, UX, or the overall product. Well suited for when you need to conduct quick usability studies. Easier to schedule and a lot less costly because there are no recruiting and traveling costs. Certain tools like Skype, Zoom or WebEx may not be available or usable if participants do not have good internet connectivity.</p>

Content density preferences can vary from one culture to another. Users in Asian countries such as Japan are comfortable with viewing content-dense websites and applications, while users in western countries such as the United States like more content-light designs that provide plenty of padding and white space between elements. One example is Rakuten, their website homepage design varies depending on your geographical location. 

## Example

<img src="/culture/rakuten1.png" title="Airbnb English" class="Image" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; border-color: gray; border-radius: 4px">
<p style="text-align: center">Rakuten page in Japan</p>

<br />
<img src="/culture/rakuten2.png" title="Airbnb English" class="Image" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; border-color: gray; border-radius: 4px">
<p style="text-align: center">Rakuten page in the United States</p>

## Important Note

To determine the optimal content density, we should know the existing norms around content density for the culture, but we should also conduct further user research to see if there are more perfect solutions.

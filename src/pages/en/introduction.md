Global Design is an introductory resource of best practices for creating cross-cultural designs and building international web products.

As of 2022, there are around 5 billion internet users around the world, and the cross-cultural aspect of design is more relevant than ever. There are not many resources for designing products that span multiple countries and continents. This project hopes to be a space that teaches and inspires new designers about global design.

This site is a work in progress. If you are interested in helping to build this resource, please reach out here [(email)](mailto:ericdai@sas.upenn.edu).

## Principles

Here are some principles to focus on when designing global web products.

<div class="highlightbox">
    <h4>Intentionality</h4>
    <p>Designers must be very intentional about the approach that they take to design for their specific international audience and know whether their design is trying to either internationalize or localize.</p>
</div>

<div class="highlightbox2">
    <h4>Understanding</h4>
    <p>It is essential for designers to be objective about their assumptions and biases. Practice high levels of user empathy to create designs that are loved by users from various backgrounds.</p>
</div>

<div class="highlightbox3">
    <h4>Detail-Oriented</h4>
    <p>Effectively designing international products means being meticulous with every aspect of the design to make sure the final product has great usability and user experience across the user groups.</p>
</div>

<div class="highlightbox4">
    <h4>Continuity</h4>
    <p>Culture and user preferences are continuously evolving. Adopt a design process cycle that allows for efficient user testing and user research so that designs can be refined regularly.</p>

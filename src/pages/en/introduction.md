Global Design is a introductory resource for guidelines that pertain to best practices for creating cross-cultural designs and building international web products.

As more and more international web products are created, it is important for product designers who are designing for global audiences to understand the cross-cultural aspect of design. Additionally, it is important to structure and refine our approach to creating products that span multiple countries, continents, or various demographics. This project hopes to address the demand for resources that address the frameworks for designing global products.

This site is a work in progress. If you are interested in helping to build this resource, please reach out here [(email)](mailto:ericdai@sas.upenn.edu).

    <h4>Intentionality</h4>
    <p>Designers must be very intentional about the approach that they take to design for their specific international audience and know whether their design is trying to either internationalize or localize.</p>

<div class="highlightbox2">
    <h4>Understanding</h4>
    <p>It is essential for designers to be objective about their assumptions and biases. Practice high levels of user empathy to create designs that are loved by users from various backgrounds.</p>
</div>

<div class="highlightbox3">
    <h4>Detail-Oriented</h4>
    <p>Effectively designing international products means being meticulous with every aspect of the design to make sure the final product has great usability and user experience across the user groups.</p>
</div>

<div class="highlightbox4">
    <h4>Continuity</h4>
    <p>Culture and user preferences are continuously evolving. Adopt a design process cycle that allows for efficient user testing and user research so that designs can be refined regularly.</p>

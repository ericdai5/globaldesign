Color is the foundational building block of every design, and designers use colors to convey both message and mood. Even though there is a lot of room to experiment with color schemes in design systems, at the international level, designers should also make sure that color choices do not offend or confuse the customers. Below are some color choices and how they could be perceived differently.

## Colors

## Important Note

When deciding on color choices, designers can also research the importance of color symbolism in their target countries. In western countries, which tend to have more culturally heterogenous populations, color symbolism tends to matter less compared to countries where the populations are more culturally homogenous.
